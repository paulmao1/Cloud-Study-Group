server:
        verbosity: 1
## Specify the interface address to listen on:
##    interface: 10.0.0.1
## To listen on all interfaces use:
        interface: 0.0.0.0
        do-ip4: yes
        do-ip6: yes
        do-udp: yes
        do-tcp: yes
        do-daemonize: yes
        access-control: 0.0.0.0/0 allow
## Other access control examples
## access-control: 68.1.0/24 action
## 'action' should be replaced by any one of:
#deny (drop message)
#refuse (sends  a  DNS  rcode REFUSED error message back)
#allow (recursive ok)
#allow_snoop (recursive and nonrecursive ok).
## Minimum lifetime of cache entries in seconds.  Default is 0.
#cache-min-ttl: 60
## Maximum lifetime of cached entries. Default is 86400 seconds (1  day).
#cache-max-ttl: 172800
## enable to not answer id.server and hostname.bind queries.
        hide-identity: yes
## enable to not answer version.server and version.bind queries.
        hide-version: yes
## default is to use syslog, which will log to /var/log/messages.
use-syslog: yes
## to log elsewhere, set 'use-syslog' to 'no' and set the log file location below:
#logfile: /var/log/unbound
python:
remote-control:
        control-enable: no
## Stub zones are like forward zones (see below) but must only contain authority server (no recursive servers)
#stub-zone:
#        name: "my.test.com"
#                stub-addr: 172.16.1.1
#                stub-addr: 172.16.1.2
## Note for forward zones, the destination servers must be able to handle recursion to other DNS server
# Forward all *.example.com queries to the server at 192.168.1.1
forward-zone:
        name: "tianma.cn"
        forward-addr: 10.158.159.2
## Forward all other queries to the Verizon DNS servers
forward-zone:
        name: "."
        forward-addr: 8.8.8.8
